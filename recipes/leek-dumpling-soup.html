    <h2>Description</h2><p>This warming, zippy Leek Dumpling Soup takes 15 minutes to prepare. You'll love the flavourful lemon ginger broth, but the best part of all is the huge handful of greens that are thrown right into the pot at the end, giving it a beautiful burst of vibrance and nutrients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>1 leek, white parts, thinly sliced (or sub 1 shallot or 1/2 cup onion)</li>
<li>4 slices ginger (the size of a quarter, leave peels on- or 1 tablespoon ginger paste)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
<li>8-10 dumplings</li>
<li>salt and lemon juice to taste</li>
<li>a couple handful of chopped greens- baby spinach, arugula, bok choy, chopped kale</li>
<li>garnish options: scallions, cilantro, sesame seeds, chili flakes or sriracha</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
<li>In a medium pot, saute the leeks and ginger in oil, over medium heat, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the broth, cover, and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Add the wontons and simmer according to directions on the package ( 3-5 minutes- depending on size) They normally float when cooked through.</li>
<li>Taste the broth and add salt and a squeeze of lemon if you like. I like mine quite lemony, but season to your own taste.</li>
<li>Drop in the greens, cooking until wilted. Spinach will take 45 seconds, kale will take longer.</li>
<li>Divide among two bowls and sprinkle with any of the garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
